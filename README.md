# React render() Must Not Have Side Effects

## Objectives

1. Review the requirements of `render()`
2. Explain why `render()` must not have side effects

## Overview

This quiz is meant to give students a chance to review how to write a proper
`render()` function. It's a review of pure functions and also a refresher about
`render()` before we dive into props and state.

We can use this space to go over anything we might have missed in earlier units,
and to really drive home how important `render()` is.
